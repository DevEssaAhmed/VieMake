## Getting Started

1. Open [Supaboost Documentation](https://supaboost.dev/docs)
2. Continue from there

### Explanation

The general explanation for Supaboost is too long to inform you through a single Readme file.

Supaboost consists of different modules, which all need to correspond to be able to make it work. A single file is not enough, which is why we explain it in greater detail on our documentation pages.

Happy hacking!
